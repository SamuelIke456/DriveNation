  <section class="intro">
    <p>**WM Motor**, also known as **Weltmeister**, is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer founded in **2015** by **Freeman Shen**, a former executive at Geely and Volvo. The company’s name “Weltmeister” is German for “World Champion,” reflecting its ambition to become a global leader in electric mobility. Headquartered in **Shanghai**, WM Motor focuses on producing **affordable, smart, and efficient electric cars** for China’s growing middle class.

WM Motor’s lineup includes models such as the **EX5**, **EX6**, and **W6** — electric SUVs that combine practicality, comfort, and advanced technology. The **W6**, in particular, features **autonomous driving capabilities** powered by Baidu’s Apollo platform and an intelligent voice assistant system. These vehicles are designed with a focus on **user experience and connectivity**, offering large touchscreen displays, over-the-air software updates, and mobile app integration.

The company emphasizes **mass-market accessibility**, aiming to make electric cars available to a wide range of consumers rather than focusing solely on the luxury segment. WM Motor also develops its own **battery and motor technologies**, as well as a digital ecosystem that includes online sales, data services, and remote vehicle management. This approach helps lower costs and improve performance while enhancing customer convenience.

WM Motor’s vision is to create a **smart, sustainable mobility ecosystem** that supports China’s transition to green energy. Despite facing tough competition from other EV brands like NIO, Xpeng, and BYD, WM Motor remains a significant player in the Chinese EV market. With continued innovation and a focus on affordability, the company aims to expand globally and make intelligent electric vehicles accessible to everyone.
