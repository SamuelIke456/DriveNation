    <p>**VinFast** is a Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer founded in **2017** by **Phạm Nhật Vượng**, the billionaire chairman of the **Vingroup** conglomerate. Headquartered in **Hanoi, Vietnam**, VinFast is the country’s first major global car brand and a symbol of Vietnam’s growing technological ambitions. The company aims to become a leading name in sustainable mobility by producing modern, affordable, and eco-friendly electric vehicles for global markets.

VinFast started by producing gasoline-powered cars but quickly shifted its focus to **fully electric vehicles**. Its lineup includes models such as the **VF 3, VF 6, VF 7, VF 8, and VF 9**, covering a range of compact to full-size SUVs. These vehicles are designed with sleek, futuristic looks and equipped with smart features like **driver-assist systems, digital dashboards, and AI-powered interfaces**. The VF 8 and VF 9, in particular, are being exported to markets like the **United States, Canada, and Europe**, making VinFast one of the few Asian automakers to challenge Western EV brands.

A major part of VinFast’s strategy is its commitment to **sustainability and accessibility**. The company aims to make electric mobility available to everyone by offering competitive prices, strong warranty programs, and innovative ownership options, including **battery subscription plans**. It also invests in **charging infrastructure** across Vietnam and international markets to support its customers and promote green transportation.

VinFast represents Vietnam’s entrance into the global EV race, blending ambition, innovation, and national pride. With strong backing from Vingroup and growing global recognition, VinFast continues to expand its reach and improve its technology. Its long-term vision is to become a **world-class electric vehicle brand**, leading the transition toward cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable transportation worldwide.
