  <section class="intro">
    <p>The history of Audi e-trons began with the **2009 e-tron concept**, an all-electric sports car that showcased Audi’s future vision. This was followed by the **A3 Sportback e-tron** plug-in hybrid in 2014, Audi’s first step toward electrification. The big breakthrough came in **2018**, when Audi launched its first fully electric production SUV, simply called the **e-tron** (later renamed **Q8 e-tron**), which became a best-seller in markets like Norway. In 2020, Audi expanded the lineup with the **Sportback** version, and in 2021 introduced the **e-tron GT**, a high-performance electric sedan built alongside the Porsche Taycan, as well as the compact **Q4 e-tron** SUV. More recently, Audi unveiled the **A6 e-tron** and **Q6 e-tron** (2023–2024), both built on the new PPE platform, signaling Audi’s commitment to a fully electric future. Together, the e-tron family represents Audi’s transition from experimental concepts to a diverse lineup of luxury electric vehicles.
</p>

    <p>The purpose of the Audi e-tron lineup is to represent Audi’s shift toward **sustainable mobility** while maintaining the brand’s reputation for **luxury, performance, and innovation**. Through the e-tron range, Audi aims to reduce carbon emissions, compete in the growing EV market, and meet stricter global regulations on fuel efficiency. At the same time, the e-trons serve to show that electric vehicles can deliver the same **driving dynamics, comfort, and cutting-edge technology** that customers expect from Audi, making electrification an attractive choice rather than a compromise.
