    <p>**Xpeng Motors**, officially known as **Xiaopeng Motors**, is a leading Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer founded in **2014** by **He Xiaopeng** and **Henry Xia**. Headquartered in **Guangzhou, China**, Xpeng focuses on building **smart, connected, and high-performance electric cars**. The company is often compared to Tesla because of its strong emphasis on technology, autonomous driving, and software integration, but it aims to offer similar innovation at a more affordable price.

Xpeng’s lineup includes several popular models, such as the **P7** (a sleek electric sedan), **G6** and **G9** (intelligent SUVs), and the **P5**, which is one of the world’s first production cars equipped with **Lidar sensors** for advanced self-driving capabilities. These vehicles feature **cutting-edge infotainment systems**, **voice-controlled assistants**, and **over-the-air (OTA)** updates, allowing the cars to improve their performance and features over time.

A major strength of Xpeng is its focus on **autonomous driving technology**. The company developed its own system, called **Xpeng Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP)**, which enables highway and city-level self-driving functions. Xpeng also operates a network of **supercharging stations** across China and is expanding its presence in **Europe**, with deliveries in countries like Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

Xpeng’s vision is to make **smart electric mobility accessible to everyone**. It integrates artificial intelligence, data, and connectivity to create cars that are not just vehicles but intelligent companions. With its blend of design, innovation, and affordability, Xpeng continues to be one of China’s most promising EV brands, helping to drive the global shift toward clean, autonomous, and intelligent transportation.
