  <section class="intro">
    <p>**Rivian** is an American electric vehicle manufacturer founded in 2009 by **RJ Scaringe**. Headquartered in Irvine, California, Rivian focuses on producing **electric adventure vehicles** — rugged, high-performance EVs designed for both on-road comfort and off-road exploration. The company’s goal is to combine sustainability with adventure, encouraging people to explore the world while protecting the environment.

Rivian’s first two main models are the **R1T** (an all-electric pickup truck) and the **R1S** (an all-electric SUV). Both vehicles are built on the same “**skateboard platform**,” which houses the battery, motors, and suspension in one flat structure. This design allows for more space, stability, and flexibility. The R1T was the first electric pickup truck to reach the market, offering features like quad-motor all-wheel drive, a “gear tunnel” for extra storage, and over **500 kilometers of range** on a single charge.

In addition to consumer vehicles, Rivian also produces **electric delivery vans** for Amazon, one of its major investors. These vans are part of Rivian’s effort to help companies reduce carbon emissions in transportation and logistics. Rivian is also building a network of **“Rivian Adventure Network”** charging stations and **service centers** across the U.S., designed for long-distance travel and outdoor lifestyles.

Rivian’s mission is centered on **sustainability, innovation, and community**. The company promotes a clean-energy future by using eco-friendly materials, renewable energy in its factories, and recyclable components in its vehicles. By blending technology, durability, and environmental responsibility, Rivian has positioned itself as a leading force in the growing electric vehicle market — appealing to drivers who want both performance and purpose.
