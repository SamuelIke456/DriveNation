    <h1>ZeekrEV</h1>
    <p>Co-creating the Future of Mobility Experiences.</p>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>**Zeekr** is a premium electric vehicle (EV) brand from China, founded in **2021** by **Geely Holding Group**, the same company that owns Volvo and Lotus. Headquartered in **Hangzhou, China**, Zeekr was created to compete in the luxury EV segment and appeal to younger, tech-savvy drivers. The brand name “Zeekr” comes from the words **“geek”** and **“zeal,”** symbolizing innovation, technology, and passion for smart mobility.

Zeekr’s first model, the **Zeekr 001**, is a luxury electric shooting brake (a sporty hatchback design) that combines performance, range, and comfort. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in under 4 seconds and offers a range of up to **700 kilometers** on a single charge. Other models like the **Zeekr 009** (a high-end electric MPV) and **Zeekr X** (a compact luxury SUV) show the brand’s commitment to blending style, practicality, and advanced technology.

All Zeekr vehicles are built on Geely’s **Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA)** platform — a highly flexible EV chassis that supports powerful batteries, fast charging, and smart driving systems. The cars come equipped with **cutting-edge infotainment systems**, **AI-powered voice assistants**, and **autonomous driving capabilities**. Zeekr also emphasizes sustainability by using **eco-friendly materials** and focusing on energy efficiency throughout production.

Zeekr aims to become a **global leader in premium electric mobility**. It has begun expanding into **European markets** like the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, offering an alternative to Western luxury EV brands such as Tesla and Polestar. With its mix of bold design, high performance, and intelligent features, Zeekr represents China’s modern vision of what luxury electric driving should be — **smart, stylish, and sustainable**.
