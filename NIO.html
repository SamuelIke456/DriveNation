  <section class="intro">
    <p>**NIO** is a Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company founded in 2014 and headquartered in Shanghai. It focuses on designing and producing smart, high-performance electric cars that compete with brands like Tesla. NIO is well known for its innovation in battery technology, especially its **battery swapping system**, which allows drivers to change their car batteries in just a few minutes instead of waiting for them to charge. This has made NIO one of the most advanced EV companies in China and the world.

The company produces several models, including the **ES6, EC7, ET7, and ET5**, all of which combine luxury design with strong performance. NIO’s vehicles are equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems and smart connectivity features, offering a modern and comfortable driving experience. The sleek designs, long battery range, and strong acceleration make NIO cars popular among tech-savvy and environmentally conscious drivers.

Another key part of NIO’s success is its **Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS)** program. This allows customers to buy a car without the battery, reducing the price, and then subscribe to a monthly battery plan. The company also builds **Power Swap Stations** across China and other countries, giving users an easy and fast way to replace or upgrade batteries. This system shows NIO’s creative approach to solving charging and range problems faced by many EV owners.

NIO’s vision goes beyond just selling cars — it aims to build a **community and lifestyle around smart mobility**. It runs events and clubs where owners connect and share experiences. With its focus on innovation, sustainability, and user experience, NIO is shaping the future of electric vehicles and pushing China toward a greener and smarter transportation era.
