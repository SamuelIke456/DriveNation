  <section class="intro">
    <p>Karma Automotive is an American electric and hybrid luxury car manufacturer headquartered in Irvine, California. The company was established in 2014 after the assets of Fisker Automotive were acquired by Wanxiang Group, a Chinese automotive supplier. Karma Automotive was created to continue the vision of producing stylish, eco-conscious vehicles with premium performance and design.

The brand’s most well-known model is the Karma Revero, a luxury plug-in hybrid sedan that blends electric driving with a gasoline engine for extended range. The Revero retained the sleek exterior styling of the original Fisker Karma but was upgraded with improved technology, performance, and interior quality. It represents Karma’s commitment to combining sustainability with a high-end driving experience.

In addition to the Revero, Karma has explored new concepts and platforms aimed at expanding its lineup. Vehicles like the GS-6 and future all-electric models are part of its effort to stay competitive in the growing EV market. Karma also offers its E-Flex platform, a flexible electric vehicle architecture that can be adapted for multiple body styles and powertrains.

Karma Automotive emphasizes craftsmanship and personalization. Its cars are built with attention to detail, premium materials, and modern infotainment systems. The brand targets a niche market of customers who want exclusivity, eco-friendly technology, and distinctive design rather than mass-market vehicles.

Looking ahead, Karma faces challenges in scaling production and competing with larger EV manufacturers. However, its focus on innovation, luxury, and sustainable driving keeps it relevant in the premium segment. If it continues to evolve and expand its electric lineup, Karma could remain a unique choice for drivers seeking both style and environmental responsibility.</p>
