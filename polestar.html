    <p>**Polestar** is a Swedish electric vehicle manufacturer that was originally a performance division of Volvo Cars. It became an independent brand in 2017, focusing entirely on designing and producing premium electric vehicles. Headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, Polestar combines **Scandinavian design, advanced technology, and sustainability** to create stylish, high-performance EVs that appeal to modern drivers. Its cars reflect minimalism, efficiency, and innovation — values that define Swedish automotive engineering.

The company’s first car, the **Polestar 1**, was a luxury hybrid coupe known for its elegant design and strong performance. It was followed by the **Polestar 2**, a fully electric fastback that became the brand’s first mass-production EV and a direct competitor to the Tesla Model 3. The Polestar 2 is known for its solid build, clean design, and use of **Google’s Android Automotive OS**, which provides built-in Google Maps, Assistant, and Play Store for a connected driving experience.

Polestar continues to expand its lineup with newer models like the **Polestar 3** (an electric SUV) and the **Polestar 4** (a coupe-style SUV). These cars are built with a focus on safety, luxury, and environmental responsibility. The company is also developing the **Polestar 5**, an electric grand tourer based on the Precept concept, which showcases Polestar’s vision for the future of electric mobility.

Sustainability is at the heart of Polestar’s mission. It aims to build a **completely climate-neutral car by 2030**, eliminating emissions from production and supply chains. Through transparency reports and eco-friendly materials, Polestar sets an example for the global auto industry. With its blend of design, performance, and sustainability, Polestar stands as one of the most innovative and eco-conscious electric car brands in the world.
