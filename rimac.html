  <section class="intro">
    <p>**Rimac Automobili** is a Croatian electric hypercar manufacturer founded in 2009 by **Mate Rimac**. The company is headquartered near Zagreb, Croatia, and is recognized globally for pushing the limits of electric vehicle technology. Rimac began with a dream to prove that electric cars could be faster and more exciting than traditional gasoline supercars — a vision that has now made it one of the most respected names in the high-performance EV world.

Rimac’s first car, the **Concept_One**, debuted in 2011 and was one of the world’s fastest electric cars at the time. It featured incredible acceleration and innovative battery systems, gaining worldwide attention despite being produced in very limited numbers. The company’s next model, the **Rimac Nevera**, took electric performance to new heights. The Nevera produces an astonishing **1,914 horsepower** and can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just **1.85 seconds**, making it one of the quickest production cars ever built.

Beyond building its own vehicles, Rimac also supplies **electric powertrain and battery technology** to other major automakers, including Porsche, Bugatti, Koenigsegg, and Aston Martin. This expertise in high-performance electric systems has made Rimac a valuable partner in the transition to electric mobility. In fact, Rimac now jointly owns **Bugatti Rimac**, a company formed through a partnership with Porsche to combine luxury, heritage, and innovation.

Rimac’s mission goes beyond speed — it aims to redefine what electric cars can do. With its focus on performance, technology, and sustainability, the company continues to lead innovation in the EV industry. Rimac’s story is also a symbol of how a small startup from Croatia became a global leader in electric supercars, proving that passion and innovation can compete with the biggest names in the automotive world.
