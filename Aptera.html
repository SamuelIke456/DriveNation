    <h1>Aptera: The Solar EV</h1>
    <p>Revolutionizing mobility with solar-charged efficiency</p>
  </header>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>Aptera Motors is a California-based startup focused on building the world’s most efficient solar electric vehicles. Founded with the mission to drastically reduce energy consumption in transportation, Aptera takes a unique approach with its lightweight composite materials, aerodynamic three-wheeled design, and solar technology. Their vehicles can generate up to 40 miles of free daily driving directly from sunlight, making them far less dependent on charging infrastructure compared to conventional EVs.</p>

    <p>What makes Aptera stand out is its bold vision for the future of mobility. With ranges projected up to 1,000 miles on a single charge, Aptera is pushing the limits of what an EV can achieve while offering futuristic styling and practical sustainability. By combining solar integration with cutting-edge engineering, Aptera hopes to create a new category of ultra-efficient vehicles that are both environmentally friendly and cost-effective to operate, reshaping the way we think about cars and energy use.</p>
