    <p>Accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy</p>
  </header>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>**Tesla** is an American electric vehicle (EV) and clean energy company founded in **2003** by a group of engineers, including **Elon Musk**, who later became its CEO and public face. Headquartered in **Austin, Texas**, Tesla’s mission is to **accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy**. The company produces electric cars, solar products, and energy storage systems, making it one of the most influential forces driving global innovation in renewable technology.

Tesla’s lineup includes popular models such as the **Model S** (luxury sedan), **Model 3** (affordable sedan), **Model X** (SUV), and **Model Y** (compact SUV). These vehicles are known for their **long driving range, advanced software, and powerful acceleration**. Tesla cars also feature **Autopilot**, a semi-autonomous driving system that assists with steering, braking, and lane control. The company continues to push toward full self-driving capability through constant software updates delivered over the air.

In addition to vehicles, Tesla is deeply involved in the **clean energy sector**. It produces solar panels, **Solar Roofs**, and **Powerwall** batteries for home energy storage. Its large-scale **Gigafactories** around the world manufacture batteries and EV components at massive scale, reducing costs and increasing global EV availability. Tesla’s focus on vertical integration — controlling production from batteries to final vehicles — sets it apart from most traditional automakers.

Tesla’s influence goes far beyond cars. It has changed how people think about electric vehicles, proving that they can be fast, stylish, and practical. With a focus on **innovation, sustainability, and technology**, Tesla continues to lead the global EV revolution. The company’s vision for a cleaner, smarter planet continues to inspire industries and consumers worldwide to move toward a zero-emission future.
